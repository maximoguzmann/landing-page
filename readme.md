# Landing Page Project — CSS & Flexbox TOP

This project is a **responsive landing page** created to practice and demonstrate what I've learned about **CSS fundamentals** and especially **Flexbox layout techniques**.

---

### 🎨 **CSS Skills Demonstrated**

- Understanding of the **box model**
- Use of **CSS selectors** (class, id, attribute, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements)
- Custom properties (**CSS variables**) for colors and spacing
- Use of **HSL / HEX / RGB** color formats
- Styling buttons, links, typography, and sections
- Use of `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` states
- Basic responsive adjustments

### 📐 **Flexbox Techniques Used**

- `display: flex` for layout structure
- `justify-content` and `align-items` for spacing and alignment
- `flex-direction` (row / column layouts)
- `flex-wrap` for responsiveness
- `gap` for spacing consistency
- Creating reusable Flexbox layout components (navbars, hero sections, cards, etc.)
